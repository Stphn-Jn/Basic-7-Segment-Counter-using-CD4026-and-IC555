# Basic 7-Segment Counter using CD4026 and IC555

This project demonstrates different ways to drive a 7-segment display using the CD4026 decade counter IC and an IC555 timer.
It includes three circuit variations:

Automatic Counter with Adjustable Speed – IC555 in astable mode with potentiometer for speed control.

Manual Counter with Push Button – Step-by-step counting using a button.

Manual Counter with Reset – Manual counting with reset to zero at any point (e.g., after reaching 5).

Perfect for beginners learning digital electronics, counters, and 7-segment display control.
